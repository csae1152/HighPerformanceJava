Programming techniques for high-performance Java

GARBAGE COLLECTION TUNING (HOTSPOT JVM)
=======================================

- Generational Garbage Collection
- Serial / Parallel Garbage Collection
- Concurrent Garbage Collection (CMS)
- Garbage First Collector (G1)
- GC Profiling
- Throughput Tuning 
- Pause Tuning 
- G1 Tuning

Most common java programming errors:
====================================

1. NullPointerException
2. Race conditions
3. Leaks

Java 8 and performance issues
============================================

1. Lambda expressions 

New introduced lambdas in Java 8 have a few performance advantages over anonymous inner classes which you had to use before Java 8 to "mimize" lamdas in Java.
